How to use this piece of code on VS Code

1) Create a virtual Python environment (I used venv and the latest release of Python)
2) Place the database extraction files inside the "database_extraction_files" directory.
3) Type "python3 main.py sample-file.csv" and replace the sample-file.csv with the path to your desired sample file.
4) After executing the command, you will find the sample files inside the "database_extraction_files" directory.
